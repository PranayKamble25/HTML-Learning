        <h3>Ladakh  is a region in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir between the Kunlun mountain range in the north and<br> the main Great Himalayas to the south, inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent. </h3>
        <h3> It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in Kashmir. Historically, the region included the Baltistan (Baltiyul) valleys,<br> the Indus Valley, the remote Zangskar, Lahaul and Spiti to the south,</h3>
        <h3> Ngari including the Rudok region and Guge in the east, and Nubra valleys to the north over Khardung La in the Ladakh mountain range.</h3> 
        <h3>Since Ladakh opened its doors to tourists in the 1970s, its snowcapped peaks, <br> the clear blue skies and the vistas of barren mountains broken only by blue meandering rivers has attracted many an intrepid traveler.</h3> 
        <h3>Tourism is the main source of livelihood for Ladakhis. Indian Army maintains a strong presence in Ladakh due to its strategic location.</h3> 
        <h3>The scenic beauty, the rugged terrain, the majestic mountains and the challenge of roughing it out, <br> has made Ladakh a favorite with mountaineering enthusiasts. </h3>
